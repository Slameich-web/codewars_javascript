Create a parser to interpret and execute the Deadfish language.

Deadfish operates on a single value in memory, which is initially set to 0.

It uses four single-character commands:

i: Increment the value
d: Decrement the value
s: Square the value
o: Output the value to a result array
All other instructions are no-ops and have no effect.

Examples
Program "iiisdoso" should return numbers [8, 64].
Program "iiisdosodddddiso" should return numbers [8, 64, 3600].
