Create a function taking a positive integer between 1 and 3999 (both included) as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. There cannot be more than 3 identical symbols in a row.

In Roman numerals:

1990 is rendered: 1000=M + 900=CM + 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC.
2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.
1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.
Example:

   1 -->       "I"
1000 -->       "M"
1666 --> "MDCLXVI"
