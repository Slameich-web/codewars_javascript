Description:
Encrypt this!

You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

Your message is a string containing space separated words.
You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
The second letter must be switched with the last letter
Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.
Examples:
encryptThis("Hello") === "72olle"
encryptThis("good") === "103doo"
encryptThis("hello world") === "104olle 119drlo"
